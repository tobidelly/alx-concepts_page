# Web Server

**Do not mix up web server and server.**

A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.

But you might hear people referring to a **web server** using the word **server**. (Check out the **server** concept page to learn more about this.)

As mentioned above, a server is a physical machine, an actual computer, but in the Cloud era that could also be a virtual computer, generally called a VM ([Virtual Machine](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/2oI-LKFT4-2suWSN5d7E7g "Virtual Machine")) or [container](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/q29wOsxE7vEK3mbpyrkZ2A "container").
