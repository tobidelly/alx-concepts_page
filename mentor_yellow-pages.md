> Welcome to the ALX Software Engineering Program! Here, our dedicated mentors are like your personal GPS, guiding you through the twists and turns of your learning journey.
> 
> While we thrive on peer-based collaboration, we know there are moments when you need expert advice. That’s when our mentors step in, offering the insights and technical know-how to keep you on the right path. Together, we’re navigating the road to success, and we’re excited to have you along for the ride!
> 
> # Mentor Expertise and Support
> 
> Our mentors are skilled in different programming languages and technical ideas. They have the know-how to guide you in specific topics, making sure you’re comfortable and on track with your learning.
> 
> The program spans four sections over twelve months, each delving into related concepts with the specialization having the option to choose between front end or back end. Think of the section as months with related content, happening after every three months.
> 
> After each section, you will have a break and when you get back you will have new mentors to support you and they will introduce you to the new section.

# Guided Support and Interaction

> In each section, there are special mentors who know a lot about that area. Think of them as experts who really get what you’re learning. They know the common problems you might run into and are there to help with those issues and guide you through projects.

# Getting Support you Need

There are several ways to connect with mentors:

**1\. Sessions**

> Engage in interactive sessions led by section mentors. These sessions will cover specific concepts, address questions, and provide guidance when you encounter roadblocks.

**2\. Discord**

> Our official communication platform, Discord, is where you can interact with mentors and peers, ask questions, and receive important updates. Regularly check Discord, to stay informed.
