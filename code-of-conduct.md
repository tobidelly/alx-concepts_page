Released: 12.08.2024 Effective: 12.08.2024

Community Guidelines exist to support healthy and open discussions that are valued in ALX. These guidelines create a safe environment where we can come together as a community in pursuit of our shared mission. It is critical that we honor the trust and uphold the integrity of our platforms. The Community Guidelines is official policy and apply to all ALX SE participants who interact on Discord or during the Peer Learning Days and Learning and Community Sessions. There are rules for what is allowed, and standards for what is acceptable content. To address new risks and harms, the guidelines are updated on an ongoing basis.

To help you read through the guidelines, we organize them by topic, and highlight each rule in bold. If you are ever in doubt or unsure about what you can or cannot share, please remember to be kind and treat others the way you would want to be treated.

Thank you for helping to keep the ALX SE Community a welcoming space for everyone!
