# Portfolio Project Overview

## What’s a Portfolio Project?

The Portfolio Project will be a project you will showcase on your resumé, online, and during interviews. A completed Portfolio Project will consist of:

-   A landing page describing your project
-   A comprehensive `README.md`
-   A demo of the project
-   A presentation
-   A blog post

## Why build a Portfolio project?

The Portfolio Project serves several different purposes:

1.  Highlights a Student’s unique interests and background when networking, or interviewing with potential employers.
2.  Provides a realistic workplace scenario where engineers create a solution to fit loosely defined requirements, break this down into concrete tasks and implement on a deadline.
3.  Allows for self-directed learning to explore a new technical topic, deepen understanding of a curriculum-covered topic, or use technology to bring an idea to life.

## Timeline and checkpoints

Projects can be developed alone, or in teams of up to 3 students. The technologies and project concept are defined by the student teams.
