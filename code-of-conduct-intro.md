# Code of conduct

## Introduction

ALX Africa SE Programme aims to be a safe training space for all learners, who can interact and learn without fearing harassment, prejudice, discrimination and violation of their intellectual property.

**Signing off this code of conduct will grant you access to the two learning platforms you are going to use throughout your learning journey - the Intranet and Discord workspace**. Both of them are equally important and you are expected to comply with the present code of conduct while navigating in both; failure to do so will result in precise consequences which may include temporary suspension from either one of the platforms or forced dismissal from the Programme, without permission to reapply for the next two years.

Please read the document carefully, along with the Terms of Use, [Standards and Guidelines](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/mYyqCTDzT4nADw-8xiIcnQ "Standards and Guidelines") and [Enforcement Responsibilities and Guidelines](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/cfgtEhhddxUYbK8izVun2g "Enforcement Responsibilities and Guidelines") related to it.

The SE Programme at ALX Africa adopted the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, and adapted it.
