# Shell

## Manpage

Most of Unix systems are managed by using Shell. Just as you need to know a minimum number of words to have a discussion in a language, you need to know a minimum number of commands to be able to easily interact with a system. Unix systems all have, sometimes with slight differences, the same set of commands. While it is not too hard to remember commands, it might be hard to remember all of their options and how exactly to use them. The solution to this is the `man command.` Let’s go through a part of the `ssh` one, as there are few elements to know to be able to read a man page:

```
NAME
ssh — OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)

SYNOPSIS
ssh [-1246AaCfgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file] [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file] [-L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec] [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-p port]
[-Q cipher | cipher-auth | mac | kex | key] [-R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]] [user@]hostname [command]

DESCRIPTION
ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. It is intended to replace rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

```

Some tips:

-   The `NAME` will summarize what the command is doing. As it is usually super short, you might want to look at DESCRIPTION (bellow) if ever it does not gives clear enough information
-   The `SYNOPSIS` will help you to understand the structure of the command:
    -   A shell command usually have this format: `command options parameters`
    -   Options inside `[]` are optional
    -   The string without `[]` are mandatory
-   `ssh [-1246AaCfgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-D [bind_address:]port]`
    -   `ssh` is mandatory
        -   `-1246AaCfgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy` is optional
        -   `-D [bind_address:]port` is optional (with `bind_address:` being itself optional within `-D [bind_address:]port`

## Commands

Here is the (non-exhaustive) list of commands & concepts you should master to be verbose with Unix systems:

```

dig # DNS lookup utility
df # report file system disk space usage
diff # compare files line by line
du # estimate file space usage
echo # display a line of text
find # search for files in a directory hierarchy
fg # resumes suspended jobs and bring them to the foreground
grep # print lines matching a pattern
kill # send a signal to a process
less # read file with pagination
ln # create links
ls # list directory contents
lsb_release # print distribution-specific information
lsof # list open files

whereis # locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command
which # locate a command
wc # print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
xargs # build and execute command lines from standard input
| # redirect standard output to another command
&gt; # redirect standard output
&lt; # redirect standard input
&amp; # send process to background
```

## Shortcuts

Some handy shortcuts:

```
CTRL+A # go to beginning of line
CTRL+B # moves backward one character
CTRL+C # stops the current command
CTRL+D # deletes one character backward or logs out of current session
CTRL+E # go to end of line
CTRL+F # moves forward one character
CTRL+G # aborts the current editing command and ring the terminal bell
CTRL+K # deletes (kill) forward to end of line
CTRL+L # clears screen and redisplay the line
CTRL+N # next line in command history
CTRL+R # searches in your command history
CTRL+T # transposes two characters
CTRL+U # kills backward to the beginning of line
CTRL+W # kills the word behind the cursor
CTRL+Y # retrieves last deleted string
CTRL+Z # stops the current command, resume with fg in the foreground or bg in the background
